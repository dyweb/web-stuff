## Service

- [Ryver](https://ryver.com/), the free team communication tool.

  > ___[@at15][at15]:___ An alternative for [Slack](https://slack.com/).

## Lists

- [Open source at Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/opensource)

  > ___[@at15][at15]:___ Might inspire u with new project ideas for new comers (if any).
- [Mega Project List](https://github.com/karan/Projects), a list of practical projects that anyone can solve in any programming language.

  > ___[@arrowrowe][mie]:___ Seems kind of old-fashioned and easy to get startted...
- [Static Site Generators](https://staticsitegenerators.net/), the definitive listing of Static Site Generators — all 445 of them!

  > ___[@at15][at15]:___ [@ComMouse][dou] So why this site itself is so... ancient...

  > ___[@ComMouse][dou]:___ [@at15][at15] It uses [DocPad](http://docpad.org/).

## Great Works

- [MyScript Developer](https://dev.myscript.com/), World Reference for Interactive Ink and Handwriting Recognition APIs. [Try it](https://webdemo.myscript.com/views/math.html)!

  > ___[@at15][at15]:___ [This demo](https://webdemo.myscript.com/views/math.html) can recognize hand writing and give latex code!
- [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), like a CMS... without the bad bits.

  > Contentful is a content management developer platform with an API at its core.
  >
  > - __API-first__, not browser-first.
  > - __Scalable cloud__, not on-premises setup.
  > - __Content-centric__, not page-centric.
  > - __Just the content__, no presets or templates.
- [SwarmKit](https://github.com/docker/swarmkit) (by [Docker](https://github.com/docker)), a toolkit for orchestrating distributed systems at any scale.

  > Includes primitives for node discovery, raft-based consensus, task scheduling and more.
- [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach), a scalable, survivable, strongly-consistent SQL database.

  > CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database built on a transactional and strongly-consistent key-value store.
  >
  > It
  > - **scales** horizontally;
  > - **survives** disk, machine, rack, and even datacenter failures with minimal latency disruption and no manual intervention;
  > - supports **strongly-consistent** ACID transactions;
  > - and provides a familiar **SQL** API for structuring, manipulating, and querying data.

  > See also [Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/).
- [Generating Faces with Deconvolution Networks](https://github.com/zo7/deconvfaces)

## Recommendation

- [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a free, self-directed, educational retreat for people who want to get better at programming.

  > ...whether they've been coding for three decades or three months.
