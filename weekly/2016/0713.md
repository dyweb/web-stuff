> In a way, Amazon Lambda is just "upload a PHP script to my $3 shared webhost", except:
>   - JavaScript/Java/Python instead of PHP
>   - Can handle gigantic bucketloads of requests per second, transparently
If you don't expect to scale super high, and if the actual language isn't sacred to you, then you can get the exact same ease of deployment and a comparably large ecosystem of open source on your favorite el cheapo webhost.
Many of the reasons Lambda is attractive are the same reasons PHP became so popular (despite the not-so-awesome language).
