## Good Things

- [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/), an API for asynchronous programming with observable streams.

  > ReactiveX is more than an API, it's an idea and a breakthrough in programming. It has inspired several other APIs, frameworks, and even programming languages.
  >
  > GitHub: [ReactiveX](https://github.com/ReactiveX)
- [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/), a safe home for all your data.

  > Access & share your files, calendars, contacts, mail & more from any device, on your terms.
  >
  > GitHub: [Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud) and its [server component](https://github.com/nextcloud/server).
- [MyPaint](http://mypaint.org/) (GitHub: [mypaint/mypaint](https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint)), a simple drawing and painting program that works well with Wacom-style graphics tablets.
- [JW Player](https://github.com/jwplayer/jwplayer), the world's most popular embeddable media player.

  > Showcase: [3D Cube](https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-player/demos/innovation/3d-cube/).
- [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/) (GitHub: [jp9000/obs-studio](https://github.com/jp9000/obs-studio)), free, open source software for live streaming and recording.

  > Used widely......

## Languages

### Golang

- [Example programs](https://github.com/adonovan/gopl.io/) from [_The Go Programming Language_](http://www.gopl.io/).

  > We have the book [in SJTU Library][sjtu/gopl]!
- [7 Common Mistakes In Go (2015)](http://spf13.com/presentation/7-common-mistakes-in-go-2015/)
- [Golang Notes](https://github.com/luciotato/golang-notes)

  > I also start [learning golang again](https://github.com/at15/go-learning) in order to finish [Ayi](https://github.com/dyweb/Ayi).
  >
  > _[@at15][at15]_
- [Flint](https://github.com/pengwynn/flint). Check your project for common sources of contributor friction.

  > This could be included in [Ayi](https://github.com/dyweb/Ayi).

### Python

- [Spaceship Generator][SpaceshipGenerator], a Blender script to procedurally generate 3D spaceships from a random seed.

  [![step by step animation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a1studmuffin/SpaceshipGenerator/master/screenshots/step-by-step-animation.gif)][SpaceshipGenerator]
- [Nuitka](http://nuitka.net/) (GitHub: [kayhayen/Nuitka](https://github.com/kayhayen/Nuitka)), the Python compiler, a seamless replacement or extension to the Python interpreter.

  > You can use all Python library modules or and all extension modules freely. It translates the Python into a C level program that then uses "libpython" to execute in the same way as CPython does.
- [Grip](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip), GitHub Readme Instant Preview.

  > Render local readme files before sending off to GitHub.

### C

- [Checked C](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc) by Microsoft, an extension to C that adds static and dynamic checking.

  > Detect or prevent common programming errors such as buffer overruns, out-of-bounds memory accesses, and incorrect type casts.

### Java

- [InstaCapture](https://github.com/tarek360/InstaCapture), Android library to capture screenshot from your app.

### PHP

- [LazyRecord](https://github.com/corneltek/LazyRecord), an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for PHP5.

  > LazyRecord uses code generator to generate static code, which reduces runtime costs, therefore it's pretty lightweight and fast.

### Node.js / JavaScript

- [_深入理解 Node.js: 核心思想与源码分析_](https://github.com/yjhjstz/deep-into-node)

  > Powered by React Native and other Facebook open source projects.
- [Monaco Editor](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor) by Microsoft, the code editor that powers [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode).
- [_Hybrid Frameworks Tutorial_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ovilia/hybrid-framework-tutorial/details) (GitHub: [Ovilia/Hybrid-Frameworks-Tutorial](https://github.com/Ovilia/Hybrid-Frameworks-Tutorial)), a project to guide you through the whole process of making an app with hybrid solutions like ionic, react native, crosswalk and so on.
- [Pretty Diff](http://prettydiff.com/) (GitHub: [prettydiff/prettydiff](https://github.com/prettydiff/prettydiff)), language aware code comparison tool for several web based languages. It also beautifies, minifies, and a few other things.
- [Yargs](http://yargs.js.org/) (GitHub: [yargs/yargs](https://github.com/yargs/yargs)) to build interactive command line tools by parsing arguments and generating an elegant user interface.

  > See more at [Awesome Node.js](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs).
- [Kalm](https://github.com/fed135/Kalm), Node socket wrapper and optimizer.

  > Simplify and optimize your Socket communications with:
  > - Easy-to-use single syntax for all protocols
  > - Configurable packet bundling (High-level Naggle's algorithm implementation)
  > - Multiplexing for all protocols
  > - Ultra-flexible and extensible, load your own adapters and encoders
